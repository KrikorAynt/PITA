KINECT STUDIO XEF FORMAT
=========================================

An XEF file is a series of events that occur sequentially in the file. Values are stored in little-endian byte order unless otherwise specified.

XEF files may be "archived" using the KSConvert tool for Kinect Studio. This performs a stream-level compression on the data, where event data is stored as zlib format (compression signature 0x7801). This also results in changes in the way streams and events are stored in the file.

-----------------------------------------
HEADER:

byte[8]      (8) | "EVENTS1\0" - file signature
uint         (4) | unknown (always 0x05000000?)
uint         (4) | number of streams (+1, count is inflated)
ulong        (8) | size of all data (?)

-----------------------------------------
FILE METADATA:

* A series of events (with stream index 0) followed by an event that has a stream index > 0 (the first stream description)
* For compressed streams, followed by a "pseudo"-event that has 0xFFFF as stream index and 0x0000 as stream flags -- this marks the file as archived
* Metadata events follow the same format as normal events (see below), with a fixed tag length

* Tag length: 24 bytes (0x18) -- contains GUID encoded as hex
* First event data begins with the string "Properties"


-----------------------------------------
STREAMS:

Uncompressed streams:
* Starts immediately after metadata events (where stream index > 0)
* Record length: 486 (0x1E6) bytes
* Event data start: 0x4B4 + 0x1E6 * num_of_streams

Compressed streams:
* Start address: 0xC018 after end of metadata events (the first "event" after metadata has index 0xFFFF)
* Record length: 494 (0x1EE) bytes (contains additional compressed data chunk after stream description data)
* Event data stored sequentially with each stream

-----------------------------------------
STREAM DESCRIPTIONS:

* Note that the stream metadata appear to generally follow the event format, with the exception that there is extra data at the end for compressed streams
* Stream descriptions consist of two events: the first containing the name of the stream as data, and the second containing an unknown GUID and the stream semantic GUID

NAME EVENT:
* Tag data (24 bytes):
ushort       (2) | stream index
ushort       (2) | stream flags (if set to 1, the stream is compressed)
guid        (16) | stream data type id
uint         (4) | null

* Event data (292 bytes):
wchar[128] (256) | stream name (UTF-16)
ushort       (2) | unknown (cookie value 0x3333?)
ushort       (2) | tag size
ulong        (8) | unknown
ushort       (2) | stream index
ushort       (2) | stream flags
byte[20]         | unknown data

FOR COMPRESSED STREAMS:
byte[8]          | compressed chunk of data

GUID EVENT:
* Tag data (24 bytes):
byte[24]         | unknown

* Event data:
uint         (4) | unknown
wchar[39]   (78) | unknown guid string
byte[16]         | stream semantic id


-----------------------------------------
EVENTS:

* Immediately follows the stream descriptions for unarchived files
* For archived files, events are stored with each stream and appear immediately after each individual stream description (this makes reading desired events a little trickier)
* Tag data is usually 4 bytes and represents the internal frame number of the Kinect when recording
* In compressed streams, the event data is stored as zlib format (0x7801 compression signature)
* In C#, DeflateStream can be used to decompress the data back to its original form

-----------------------------------------
EVENT DATA:

* Event header size: 24 bytes (0x18)

ushort       (2) | stream index
ushort       (2) | stream flags (if set to 1, the stream is compressed)

uint         (4) | event data length 
ulong        (8) | timestamp (100-ns ticks)
uint         (4) | unknown
uint         (4) | uncompressed event data length (should be the same as event data length for uncompressed streams)
            
byte[]       (*) | tag data   (variable-length)
byte[]       (*) | event data (variable-length)

-----------------------------------------
UNKNOWN EVENT:

* Header follows typical event format, but the rest of the data format is unknown
* Possibly some sort of cache for frame indexing, a number of data sizes and indices can be seen
* These events are variable length (determined by unknown id)
* Often, a number of these events occur sequentially in the file

ushort       (2) | stream index (equal to 0xFFFF)
ushort       (2) | stream flags (equal to 0x0000)

uint         (4) | unknown id
ulong        (8) | timestamp (100-ns ticks)
uint         (4) | null
uint         (4) | null

byte[28672]      | unknown data of length 0x7000

-----------------------------------------
FOOTER:

* NOTE: Doesn't follow typical event format
* Marks the end of file, if encountering a stream index equal to the value read from the header (STREAM_COUNT + 1)

ushort       (2) | stream index - this will be equal STREAM_COUNT + 1
byte[1712]       | unknown data of length 0x6B0 (lots of 0xFFFFFFFF values observed)


=========================================
EVENT DATA FORMATS

* Each type of event has a specific format for its byte[] data
* Tag data is typically 4 bytes representing the frame number, but is not always present (stream descriptions will have tag length)
* Each data type is represented by a data type id (guid) which is found in the stream descriptions
